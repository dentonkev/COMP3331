## Protocol
Protocols define the **format**, **order** of **messages sent and received** among network entities, and **actions taken** on messages transmission, receipt.

## Internet strucutre

**Network edge**
- hosts: clients and servers
- servers often in data centers

<img src="./images/edge.png" width="300" height="auto">

**Access networks, physical media**
- wired, wireless communication links
 
<img src="./images/wired.png" width="300" height="auto">

**Network core**
- interconnected routers
- network of networks
  
<img src="./images/core.png" width="300" height="auto">

## Network Edge

### Digital subscriber line (DSL) (old)

- use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM 
  - data over DSL phone line goes to Internet
  - voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net

<img src="./images/dsl.png" width="400" height="auto">

### Cable-based access

**Hybrid fiber coax (HFC):** up to 40-1200 Mbps downstream transmission rate, 30-100 Mbps upstream transmission rate

- network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router 
  - homes share access network to cable headend

<img src="./images/cable.png" width="450" height="auto">

-  Fully optical fiber path all the way to the home (or premise or curb)

<img src="./images/nbn.png" width="500" height="auto">

### Home networks
<img src="./images/home.png" width="450" height="auto">

### LAN and WAN
**LAN (Local area network)**
- typically within or around building (~100 ft)
- 802.11b/g/n (WiFi): 11, 54, 450 Mbps transmission rate

**WAN (Wide area network)**
- provided by mobile, cellular network operator (10’s km)
- 10’sMbps
-  4G cellular networks (5G coming)

### Enterprise networks
- mix of wired, wireless link technologies, connecting a mix of switches and routers 

## Network Core
### Circuit Switching
End-end resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source and destination

<img src="./images/cir.png" width="300" height="auto">
<img src="./images/c.png" width="400" height="auto">

### Packet Switching
Hosts break application-layer messages into **packets**

- Data is sent as chunks of formatted bits (**Packets**) 
- Packets consist of a **“header”** and **“payload”**
  - payload is the data being carried
  - header holds instructions to the network for how to handle packet
- Switches “**forward**” packets based on their headers

<img src="./images/packet.png" width="450" height="auto">

- store and forward packet switching

<img src="./images/p.png" width="450" height="auto">

## Packet Overloading
<img src="./images/over.png" width="350" height="auto">
<img src="./images/over2.png" width="350" height="auto">
<img src="./images/over3.png" width="350" height="auto">
<img src="./images/over4.png" width="350" height="auto">
<img src="./images/over5.png" width="350" height="auto">

## Packet delay
Four sources of packet delay:
- propogation delay
- queueing delay
- transmission delay
- nodal processing

$L$ = packet length (bits)  
$R$ = link bandwidth (bits/sec)  
$a$ = packet arrival rate (packets/sec)

<img src="./images/del.png" width="450" height="auto">
<img src="./images/del2.png" width="450" height="auto">
<img src="./images/del3.png" width="450" height="auto">

## Packet loss
- queue (aka buffer) preceding link in buffer has finite capacity
- packet arriving to full queue dropped (aka lost)
- lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node,
source end system, or not at all

<img src="./images/ploss.png" width="450" height="auto">

## Throughput
- **Throughput**: rate (bits/time unit) at which bits are being sent from sender to receiver
- instantaneous: rate at given point in time 
- average: rate over longer period of time

<img src="./images/through.png" width="500" height="auto">

When $R_s < R_c$, average end-end throughput is $R_s$, since it is the bottleneck

## Internet protocal stack
- **Application**: supporting network applications 
  - FTP, MSTP, HTTP, email, WWW, Phone
- **Transport**: process-process data transfer
  - TCP, UDP
- **Network**: routing of datagrams from source to destination
  - IP, routing protocols
- **Link**: data transfrer between neighbouring network elements
  - Ethernet, 802.11 (WiFi), PPP
- **Physical**: bits on the wire
  - copper, fibre, radio

<img src="./images/ips.png" width="200" height="auto">

Each layer depends on layer below and supports layer above (indepdendent of others)

## Internet Layered Architecture

# Application Layer (Principles, Web, Email)

## Client-server paradigm
**Server**:
- always-on host
- permanent IP address
- often in data centers
  
**Clients**:
- contact, communicate with server
- may be intermittently connected
- may have dynamic IP addresses
- do not communicate directly with each other
- examples: HTTP, IMAP, FTP

## Processes communicating
**Process:** program running within a host  
**Client process:** process that initiates communication  
**Server process:** process that waits to be contacted
- applications wtih P2P have client and server process

## Sockets
- A **socket** is one endpoint (IP and port) of a two-way communication link between programs on a network.
  
<img src="./images/socket.png" width="500" height="auto">

- To receive messages, processes must have an **identifier**
- Host devices has a **unique 32-bit IP address** and a **port number** associated to process
  - HTTP server: port 80
  - mail server: port 25
- **Identifier** includes **both** the IP address and port number
- To send HTTP message to http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/ web server:
  - IP address: 128.119.245.12
  - Port number: 80

## Application-layer protocol defines
<img src="./images/d.png" width="550" height="auto">

### What transport service does an app need?
- **data integrity** - some apps require 100% file transfer
- **timing** - some apps require low delay (internet telephony, games)
- **throughput** - some apps require min throughput 
- **sercurity** - encryption, data integrity

## Uniform resource locator (URL)
`protocol://host-name[:port]/directory-path/resource`

- **protocol**: http, tfp, https, smtp
- **hostname**: DNS name, IP address
- **port**: defaults to protocol standard(http: 80, https: 443)
- **directory path**: file system
- **resource**: identifies resource

Example: `www.someschool.edu/someDept/pic.gif`

## HTTP overview
**HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol** 
- **client**: browser that requests,receives, (using HTTP protocol) and “displays” Web objects
- **server**: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests

<img src="./images/http.png" width="350" height="auto">

- Uses TCP
  - client initiates connection, server accepts, HTTP message exchanged
- HTTP is stateless
  - server maintains no info about previous requests
- type types of HTTP messgaes: **request, response**

### Types of HTTP requests
<img src="./images/crud.png" width="550" height="auto">

### HTTP response status codes
**200** OK
- request succeeded, requested object later in this message
  
**301 Moved Permanently**
- requested object moved

**400 Bad Request**
- request msg not understood by server

**404 Not Found**
- requested document not found on this server

### HTTP is all text
- makes protocol simple
- not the most efficient
  - "12345678" - 8 bytes
  - 12345678 - 4 bytes

## Maintaining user/server state: cookies
Web sites and client browser use **cookies** to maintain some state between transactions

<img src="./images/cookie.png" width="550" height="auto">

- authorisation
- shopping carts
- recommendations

**Cookies and Privacy**
- cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you on their site
- third party persistent cookies allow common identity to be tracket across multiple web sites

## Page Load Time (PLT)
Page Load Time (PLT) is an important metric
- from click (or typing url) until user sees page
- key measurement of web performance

Depends on many factors such as
- page content/structure,
- protocols involved and
- Network bandwidth and RTT

## Non-persistent HTTP (HTTP/1.0)
**Non-Persistent**: **One TCP connection** to fetch **one web resource** (connection then closed)
- downloading multiple objects requires multiple connections

<img src="./images/rtt.png" width="300" height="auto">

**RTT** (Round trip time): time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back

- one RTT to initiate TCP connection
- one RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes to return
- file transmission time

<img src="./images/nop.png" width="250" height="auto">

### Non-persistent HTTP response time formula

1 Object Time = 2RTT + file transmission time  

N Objects Time = N(2RTT + file transmission time)

### Concurrent Request and Responses (Possible solution to slow PLT)
- Use multiple connections in parallel
- Does not necessarily maintain order of responses

**Downsides**
- Too much overhead (so many different connections to server at once)

## Persistent HTTP (HTTP/1.1)
- server leaves TCP connection open after sending response
- subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server are sent over the same TCP connection

**Persistent without pipelineing**
- client issues new request only when previous response has been received
- one RTT for each referenced object

**Persistent pipelineing**
- introduced in HTTP/1.1
- client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object
- as little as one RTT for all the referenced objects

<img src="./images/1.1.png" width="450" height="auto">

<br>

**Better image to display persistent with pipelining**
<img src="./images/s.png" width="450" height="auto">

- line 1 - base index file
- lines 2, 3, 4 - objects on page

### Downsides of HTTP 1.1
- server responds in **FCFS**(first-come-first-served scheduling) to `GET` requests
- small object may have to wait for transmission behind large object resulting in HOL(head of line) blocking

<img src="./images/hol.png" width="500" height="auto">

## HTTP/2: mitigating HOL blocking
- transmission order of requested objects based on client-specified
object priority (not always FCFS)
- divide objects into frames, schedule frames to mitigate HOL blocking

<img src="./images/hol1.png" width="500" height="auto">

## Web caches: proxy server
Goal: satify client request without involging origin server

- user configures browser to point to a Web cache
- browser sends all HTTP requests to cache

```
if object in cache:
  cache returns cached object to client
else:
  cache requests object origin, then caches object then return
```

<img src="./images/cache.png" width="400" height="auto">

## Example: how caching improves speeds
**LAN utilisation**: data rate / LAN speed  
**Access link utilisation**: data rate / access link rate

<img src="./images/c1.png" width="425" height="auto">
<img src="./images/c2.png" width="425" height="auto">
<img src="./images/c3.png" width="425" height="auto">

- cache hit rate: chance that the HTTP request is already stored in the local web cache

## Conditional `GET`: cache at client browser
- no object transmission delay
- lower link utilisation 

**cache**: specify date of cached copy in `HTTP` request  
**If-modified-since: < date >**

**server**: response contains no object  
If cached copy is up-to-date:  
**HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified**

## Replication: improving HTTP 
Replicate popular Web site across many machines
- Spreads load on servers
- Places content closer to clients
- Helps when content isn’t cacheable

## CDN (Content Delivery Network): improving HTTP 
CDN: stores copies of content at CDN nodes
- Netflix stores copies of movies 

Subscriber requests content from CDN
- directed to nearby copy to retrieve content from

Caching and replication as a service, large-scale distributed storage infrastructure.

- Combination of (pull) caching and (push) replication
  - Pull: Direct result of clients’ requests
  - Push: Expectation of high access rate

## Electronic Mail
User Agent
- composing, editing, reading mail messages
- outgoing, incoming messages stored on server
- e.g., Outlook, iPhone mail client

mail servers:
- mailbox contains incoming messages for user
- message queue of outgoing (to be sent) mail messages
- **SMTP** protocol between mail servers to send email messages
  - client: sending mail server
  - “server”: receiving mail server

**Format**
<img src="./images/for.png" width="450" height="auto">

### Mail example:
<img src="./images/mail.png" width="450" height="auto">

### Mail access protocol
- **SMTP**: delivery/storage of e-mail messages to receiver’s server
- mail access protocol: retrieval from server
  - IMAP: Internet Mail Access Protocol: IMAP provides retrieval, deletion, folders of stored messages on server
- HTTP: provides web-based interface on top of STMP (to send), IMAP to retrieve e-mail messages
  - gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, etc. 

<img src="./images/ma.png" width="450" height="auto">

## DNS: Domain Name System
- Maps hostname to IP address (32 bit) translation
- Initially all host-address mappings were in a hosts.txt file
  
<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 3.51.39 pm.png" width="450" height="auto">

### Server Hierachy
- ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) manages root DNS domain
  
Top of hierarchy: Root servers
- Location hardwired into other servers
  
Next Level: Top-level domain (TLD) servers
- .com, .edu, etc. (several new TLDs introduced recently)
- Managed professionally

Bottom Level: Authoritative DNS servers
- Store the name-to-address mapping
- Maintained by the corresponding administrative authority

<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 3.55.28 pm.png" width="450" height="auto">

## Local DNS name servers
- Does not strictly belong to hierarchy
- Hosts learn about the local DNS server via a host configuration
protocol 
  - DHCP
- When host makes DNS query, query is sent to its local DNS server
  - local cache of recent name-to-address translation pairs 
  - acts as proxy, forwards query into hierarchy

## Iterated Query
- Implemented by Global DNS servers (the ones in hierachy)
<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 4.30.39 pm.png" width="450" height="auto">

## Recursive Query
- Implemented by Local DNS server
<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 4.31.11 pm.png" width="450" height="auto">

### Caching, Updating DNS Records
Once (any) name server learns mapping, it **caches mapping**
- cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time (TTL)
- cached entries may be out -of -date
- TLD servers typically cached in local name servers (root typically not visited)

## DNS Records
Distributed database storing **resource records (RR)**
- **RR** format: (name, value, type, ttl)
  
<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 4.49.02 pm.png" width="450" height="auto">

### Example: Inserting into DNS
Register name **networkuptopia.com** at DNS registrar 
- provide names, IP addresses of authoritative name server (primary and
secondary)
- registrar inserts NS, A RRs into .com TLD server:
  - (networkutopia.com, dns1.networkutopia.com, NS)
  - (dns1.networkutopia.com, 212.212.212.1, A)

### DNS protocol messages
DNS **query** and **reply** have the same format

<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 4.57.44 pm.png" width="400" height="auto">
<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 4.58.32 pm.png" width="400" height="auto">

### DNS Reliability
- DNS servers are replicated (primary/secondary)
- DNS uses port 53

### DNS Security

**DDOS**
Bombard root servers with traffic

**Redirect attacks**
- Man in the middle: intercept DNS queries
- DNS poisoning: send bogus replies to DNS which caches

## Peer-peer architecture (P2P)
- no need for always-on server
- peers request service from other peers and provide servce in return to other peers
- intermittently connected and change IP address

<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 10.46.49 pm.png" width="450" height="auto">

### Example: BitTorrent
- peers in torrent send/receive file chunks

<img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 11.16.01 pm.png" width="500" height="auto">

**Requesting chunks**

- At any given time, different peers have different subsets of file
- Peers ask fellow peers what chunks they have
- Peers request for missing chuncks **rarest** first

**Sending chunks (tit-for-tat)**
Peer sends chunks to those four peers currently sending chunks her chunks at highest rate
- re-evaluate top 4 every 10 secs
- every 30 secs: randomly select another peer, starts sending chunks
  - “optimistically unchoke” this peer
  - newly chosen peer may join top 4

## Video Streaming
**Videos**: sequence of image displayed at constant rate  
**Image**: array of pixels (each pixel is a bit)

Solution: use redudancy (repeated elements) within the between images to decrease number of bits used

<img src="./images/vid.png" width="300" height="auto">

## DASH: Dynamic, Adaptive, Streaming over HTTP
**Server**

- divides video into multiple chunks
- each chunkc stored, encoded at different rates
- **manifest file**: URL for different chunks

**Client**

- periodically measures server-to-client bandwidth
- consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time

**Streaming Video = encoding + DASH + playout buffering**

<img src="./images/ne.png" width="450" height="auto">

# Transport Layer
## Transport services and Protocols
- logical communication between application processes running on different hosts
- sender: breaks applications messages into segments 
- receiver: reassembles segments into messages
- Protocols available: TCP, UDP

## Highlevel: TCP and UDP
**TCP:** Transmission Control Protocol
- reliable, in-order delivery
- congestion control
- flow control
- connection setup

**UDP:** User Datagram Protocol
- unreliable, unordered delivery
- faster than TCP (used of VOIP)
- no delay or bandwidth guarantees

## Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
<img src="./images/mudu.png" width="500" height="auto">

### UDP -  Connectionless demultiplexing
When host receives UDP segment:
- Checks **destination port number** in segment and directs UDP segment to **socket** with that port number.
- UDP datagrams with **same destination port** but different source IP will be directed to **same socket at host**.

<img src="./images/less.png" width="500" height="auto">

### TCP -  Connection demultiplexing
TCP socket identified by 4-tuple:
- source IP address
- source port number
- destination IP address
- destination port number

Demux: receiver uses all four values to direct segment to appropriate socket.

**X = 80** in image below

<img src="./images/sock.png" width="350" height="auto">
<img src="./images/z.png" width="500" height="auto">

- UDP: demultiplexing using destination IP and port number
(only)
- TCP: demultiplexing using 4-tuple: source and destination IP
addresses, and port numbers

## UDP: User Datagram Protocol
Internet transport protocol with best-effort service so segments may be:
- lost
- delivered out-of-order to app

**Connectionless**
- **no handshaking** between sender and receiver (no RTT delay)
- no connection state at sender, receiver
- small header size
- no congestion control
  - UDP can still transport if network is congested
- each UDP segment handled indepdendently of others

**Applications that use UDP**
- DNS
- SNMP (network management)
- HTTP/3

If reliable transfer needed over UDP:
- add reliability **at application layer**
- add congestion control **at application layer**

### UDP: Transport Layer Actions
<img src="./images/send.png" width="500" height="auto">
<img src="./images/receive.png" width="500" height="auto">

### UDP segment format
<img src="./images/dia.png" width="500" height="auto">

### UDP Checksum
Detect errors (flipped bits) in transmitted segment
- Treat content of UDP segment as sequence of 16-bit integers and check **sum of transmitted = sum of received**

Transmitted: 5 + 6 = 11  
Received: 4 + 6 = 10  
11 $\neq$ 10, so there was a error. 

<img src="./images/add.png" width="500" height="auto">

### Checksum Example
<img src="./images/check.png" width="500" height="auto">

At the receiver, when adding all the values together the result should be a 16-bit sequence of **All 1s** (result of using 1's complement). The receiver uses an `AND` gate so result is 1, otherwise there was an error (bit flip).

## Reliable data transfer
