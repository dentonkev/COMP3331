## Protocol
Protocols define the **format**, **order** of **messages sent and received** among network entities, and **actions taken** on messages transmission, receipt.

## Internet strucutre
**Access networks, physical media**
- wired, wireless communicaiton links

**Network core**
- interconnected routers
- network of networks

## Network Edge

- hosts: clients and servers
- servers often in data centers

### Digital subscriber line (DSL) (old)

- use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM 
  - data over DSL phone line goes to Internet
  - voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net

### Cable-based access

**Hybrid fiber coax (HFC):** up to 40-1200 Mbps downstream transmission rate, 30-100 Mbps upstream transmission rate

- network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router 
  - homes share access network to cable headend

-  Fully optical fiber path all the way to the home (or premise or curb)

### Home networks

### WLAN and WAN
**WLAN**
- typically within or around building (~100 ft)
- 802.11b/g/n (WiFi): 11, 54, 450 Mbps transmission rate

**WAN**
- provided by mobile, cellular network operator (10’s km)
- 10’sMbps
-  4G cellular networks (5G coming)

### Enterprise networks
- mix of wired, wireless link technologies, connecting a mix of switches and routers 

## Network Core
### Circuit Switching
End-end resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source and destination

### Packet Switching
Hosts break application-layer messages into **packets**

- Data is sent as chunks of formatted bits (**Packets**) 
- Packets consist of a **“header”** and **“payload”**
  - payload is the data being carried
  - header holds instructions to the network for how to handle packet
- Switches “**forward**” packets based on their headers

- store and forward packet switching

## Packet Overloading

## Packet delay
Four sources of packet delay:
- propogation delay
- queueing delay
- transmission delay
- nodal processing

L = packet length (bits)  
R = link bandwidth (bits/sec)  
a = packet arrival rate (packets/sec)

## Packet loss
- queue (aka buffer) preceding link in buffer has finite capacity
- packet arriving to full queue dropped (aka lost)
- lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node,
source end system, or not at all

## Throughput
- **Throughput**: rate (bits/time unit) at which bits are being sent from sender to receiver
- instantaneous: rate at given point in time 
- average: rate over longer period of time

<img src="./images/through.png" width="500" height="auto">

When $R_s < R_c$, average end-end throughput is $R_s$, since it is the bottleneck
